Trying out Node API

## Existing functions
*This list will be updated as new functions are implemented*

- `add`: Adds two integers

## How to use?
Functions can't be used at the moment; they're not exposed. You can look at
the `index.js` file for an example of how the addon is imported and used.

## How to build?
Please find scripts in package.json:

- `npm run build` - This command will build the C++ project.
- `npm run clean`
